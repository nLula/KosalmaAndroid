REM  Load_New_Kosalma_app
REM
REM  Ships a new version of the Kosalma phone app, in the order that catches
REM  mistakes before they reach a phone you cannot physically reach:
REM
REM    1. run it on a test phone first
REM    2. you confirm it actually works
REM    3. publish the change over the air  (JavaScript changes)
REM    4. optionally build a new APK       (only if something native changed)
REM
REM  If a step is skipped or fails, nothing reaches the production phone.

REM --- Step 1: test on a real phone -----------------------------------------
echo [1/4] Starting Metro in a separate window.
echo       Scan the QR code with the TEST phone and check the new version.
echo       Leave that window open while you test; close it when done.
echo.

echo       Waiting for you to finish testing...
echo.

REM --- Step 2: the go / no-go gate ------------------------------------------
REM  Anything that is not a clear "y" stops the run. The attempt counter means
REM  that if this is ever run without a console, it aborts instead of looping.

REM --- Step 4: a new APK, only when the native side changed -----------------

echo       open until it finishes and prints the download link.
