REM  Rollback_Last_Update
REM
REM  Undoes a bad over-the-air update. It republishes the version that came
REM  before the current one, so phones move back to the last good build.
REM
REM  Note: a rollback is itself an update. The phone has to start the app once
REM  to collect it - if the bad update crashes on launch before it can fetch,
REM  the phone needs the APK reinstalled by hand instead.
